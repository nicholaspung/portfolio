description: "The goal of this is to build an application with a monolithic architecture, mainly to reduce costs in hosting servers and buying domain names. If money weren't an issue, I would instead be going with a microservice architecture for the reason of having easier maintainable code to develop, being able to use different programming languages for different situations, and most importantly to enable continuous delivery and deployment of the application."
