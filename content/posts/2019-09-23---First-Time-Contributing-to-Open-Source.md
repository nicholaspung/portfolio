I've contributed to my first open-source project: [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)! You can see my issue here [#17703](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/17703) and am documenting my first PR to GatsbyJS here [#17803](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/17803)! I'll write more on my experience contributing to GatsbyJS in the future.

## Background
As I was learning how to program with React for front-end development, I learned about GatsbyJS and how it could be used to create static sites, while using React as the main framework for code. Curious about how Gatsby worked, I decided to play around with it, creating some starter blogs using the default template. After playing around with the code, I was hooked on the whole GatsbyJS ecosystem, and how much was accessible for a newbie GatsbyJS coder. In addition, everywhere on their website showed that we were welcoming in helping new open-source contributors and had great onboarding docs to show.

I decided to create my portfolio using one of the Gatsby Starter Templates, [gatsby-starter-lumen](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen). And while creating my portfolio, I had to learn to work with Gatsby's APIs to modify it into what you see in my current portfolio.

Since I had to learn to work with the APIs, I became very familiar with Gatsby documentation and found I had trouble with certain workflows that weren't located in their docs. However, Google and StackOverflow came in really handy in helping me understand the trouble areas.

## Deciding to Contribute to Gatsby
One of the things I wanted to do when I first started learning how to code was to contribute to an open-source project that I use. Gatsby became the perfect candidate to find a way to contribute as a beginner new to the open-source community. I first went and read their ["How to Contribute" page](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/how-to-contribute/) and decided to start with a GitHub issue labelled "good first issue". As I was intimidated by some code contributions and also seeing the "assigned" availability for some easy code issues, I found a "good first issue" for documentation in helping out [learning workflows](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/13708).

From there, I decided to tackle the "Fonts and Typography" workflow because I actually had no clue how it worked and personally wanted to learn myself. So I followed the guide on the issue, and wrote out my first [open-source issue](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/17703). I went ahead and modified a page following my recommendation, then sent a [pull request](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/17803) with my change. To my surprise, it was approved!

## Reflection
What I learned from this experience is that even beginners can contribute to open-source projects, even if it's just a small change. I was invited to join the GatsbyJS organization on GitHub and even given a [free T-Shirt](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/contributor-swag/)! All in all, I'm looking forward to making more contributions to come!
