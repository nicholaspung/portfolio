Hi, I'm Nicholas! I'm a Web Developer who uses ReactJS and Java Spring Framework to make web applications. I currently attend Lambda School's Full-Stack Web Development program. Also I'm currently building a persona project on mine - A Dashboard Application that contains many different mini applications that have specific use cases. You find a the project [here](/).

Before deciding to put all my focus into becoming a Web Developer, I was fortunate enough to work under [Tom Bilyeu from Impact Theory](https://www.youtube.com/tombilyeu), where I learned and ingrained in my head that **developing skills** is one of the most important aspects in life in order to provide value to others. 

So when Impact Theory decided to join the comic book industry, we had to get a list of comic book retailers so that we could contact them. In order to save some costs, I decided learn how to use Python and Google Maps API to create an address scraper to grab all comic book retail stores. From building the address scraper, I remembered my old passion in building coding applications, and decided to pursue becoming a Web Developer full time in late April 2019.

When I'm not developing my skills as a developer, I like to train like a [powerlifter](https://usapl.liftingdatabase.com/lifters-view?id=14900), play video games, and find delicious food spots.
