Hi, I'm Nicholas! I'm a Web Developer who uses ReactJS and Java Spring Framework to make web applications. I currently attend Lambda School's Full-Stack Web Development program. 

Before deciding to put all my focus into becoming a Web Developer, I was fortunate enough to work under [Tom Bilyeu from Impact Theory](https://www.youtube.com/tombilyeu), where I learned and ingrained in my head that **developing skills** is one of the most important aspects in life in order to provide value to others. 

So when Impact Theory decided to join the comic book industry, in order to save some costs, I learned how to use Python and Google Maps API to create an address scraper to grab all comic book retail stores. There, I remembered my old passion in building coding applications, and decided to pursue becoming a Web Developer full time in late April 2019.

When I'm not developing my skills as a developer, I like to train like a [powerlifter](https://usapl.liftingdatabase.com/lifters-view?id=14900), play video games, and find delicious food spots.
