Curious about how Gatsby worked, I decided to play around with it, creating some starter blogs using the default template. After playing around with the code, I was hooked on the whole GatsbyJS ecosystem, and how much was accessible for a newbie GatsbyJS coder. In addition, everywhere on their website showed that we were welcoming in helping new open-source contributors and had great onboarding docs to show.</p>\n<p>I decided to create my portfolio using one of the Gatsby Starter Templates, <a href=\"https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">gatsby-starter-lumen</a>. And while creating my portfolio, I had to learn to work with Gatsby’s APIs to modify it into what you see in my current portfolio.</p>\n<p>Since I had to learn to work with the APIs, I became very familiar with Gatsby documentation and found I had trouble with certain workflows that weren’t located in their docs. However, Google and StackOverflow came in really handy in helping me understand the trouble areas.</p>\n<h2 id=\"deciding-to-contribute-to-gatsby\"><a href=\"#deciding-to-contribute-to-gatsby\" aria-label=\"deciding to contribute to gatsby permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Deciding to Contribute to Gatsby</h2>\n<p>One of the things I wanted to do when I first started learning how to code was to contribute to an open-source project that I use. Gatsby became the perfect candidate to find a way to contribute as a beginner new to the open-source community. I first went and read their <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/how-to-contribute/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">“How to Contribute” page</a> and decided to start with a GitHub issue labelled “good first issue”. As I was intimidated by some code contributions and also seeing the “assigned” availability for some easy code issues, I found a “good first issue” for documentation in helping out <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/13708\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">learning workflows</a>.</p>\n<p>From there, I decided to tackle the “Fonts and Typography” workflow because I actually had no clue how it worked and personally wanted to learn myself. So I followed the guide on the issue, and wrote out my first <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/17703\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">open-source issue</a>. I went ahead and modified a page following my recommendation, then sent a <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/17803\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">pull request</a> with my change. To my surprise, it was approved!</p>\n<h2 id=\"reflection\"><a href=\"#reflection\" aria-label=\"reflection permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Reflection</h2>\n<p>What I learned from this experience is that even beginners can contribute to open-source projects, even if it’s just a small change. I was invited to join the GatsbyJS organization on GitHub and even given a <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/contributor-swag/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">free T-Shirt</a>! All in all, I’m looking forward to making more contributions to come!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/contributing-to-open-source-1","tagSlugs":["/tag/gatsby-js/","/tag/open-source/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-09-23","description":"I've contributed to my first open-source project: GatsbyJS!","tags":["GatsbyJS","Open Source"],"title":"First Time Contributing to Open Source | GatsbyJS"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/contributing-to-open-source-1"}}}
