Therefore, they are able to use sessions in order to have users continue using the application while logged in. Or another solution would be to store the session data in the database, and having the client look up the database during the whole user interaction, which sounds less than ideal to me."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/struggling-with-google-oauth/","categorySlug":"/category/what-i-learned/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Standalone Node API Server with Google OAuth | Part 1","date":"2019-08-20","category":"What I Learned","description":"For my personal project, I decided to develop a standalone Node API Server that would have Google OAuth for the login/register function. I had previously created a Node Server that was housed in the same repository as the React client with Google OAuth, so I didn't think that it would be that hard to separate the two. And boy was I wrong."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"tag":"PassportJS","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":4,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/passport-js","nextPagePath":"/tag/passport-js/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}}}
